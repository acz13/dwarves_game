dwarves mod:
Beer (dwarf is not a dwarf, if he can't drink beer!) and cider brewing. (in a boxy barrel! :D [i]fixed[/i]) currently is infinite and a bit cheating, but in future i plan to code a way of water running out and refilling the barrel.

Daggers of two kinds: Ebony and Steel
Ores:
  Ebony
	Obsidian (as an ore, yes.)
	Diamond
	Ruby
	Sapphire
	Emerald
   Mithril
Alloys: (Allonsy!)
	Steel (iron+coal)
	Pobe ([url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pobedit[/url]) (steel+coal) only axe, sword and something else, which will remain a secret for now.
	Brass (iron+copper)
	Cast iron (iron+charcoal in an interesting way...)
  Adamntium
Little pieces of silver and gold

Ebony is like other ores (e. g. Iron) — you get a lump, you cook it, you make stuff.
Obsidian a bit another way — you get chunks, which you combine and get a block. Then, you use it for crafting and building.
Steel, Pobe and brass are like usual ingots. Steel and pobe are used for crafting tools. Brass is not at the moment.
Cast Iron is a block. VERY(and i'm thinking of making it stronger) strong one.
Durin's axe - Best weapon
Mithril (ore like ebony)
Adamantium (alloy = pobe + mithril + diamond, best tools in the game, a bit slower than original mese)
...and MUCH and MUCH more!!
